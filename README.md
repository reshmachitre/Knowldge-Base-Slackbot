# Kb-Slackbot
A Slack-integrated assistant that enables natural language querying of internal documentation such as runbooks, ADRs, and wikis. It uses OpenAI embeddings with a Chroma vector store for semantic search and returns summarized, context-aware answers directly in Slack. Falls back to GPT-based general knowledge when no relevant information found.
