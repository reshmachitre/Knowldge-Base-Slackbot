Handling Web Request Flooding by a Specific User or OrganizationTroubleshooting Slow Salsify App Load TimesOverviewWe receive alerts from multiple services indicating that inter-service authentication is failing, such as the ServiceSecurity::Client::TokenService::TokenGenerationError. The app also becomes slower when loading various pages. (Dashboard to check all the metrics)Runbook1. Check if any specific organization or user is making unusually high web requests: https://onenr.io/07wkMP8gnjL2. You can monitor the pod receiving the highest traffic and track compute usage using the Grafana dashboard.3. Also, refer to the System Monitoring Runbook here: System Monitoring Alerts Runbook, which includes links to Job Pump monitoring to check if specific queues are being flooded.4. As shown in the screenshot above, if it's clear that a specific organization or user is generating the excess requests, we have several options to address the issue:1. Review the user reference report to determine if they own multiple subscriptions, workflows, etc. Once the team reaches a consensus, disable the user from the UI by having another Salsify administrator log into the app.2. Once a user is disabled, the auth-service rejects any requests from them, logging the message: User attempted to login but account or organization is disabled. As a result, the request volume decreases.Monitor the request count, app performance, and Bugsnag logs to confirm if the system has recovered.3. If disabling the user isn’t sufficient, we can block the user or organization at the auth-service by setting AUTH_SERVICE_BLOCKED_ORGANIZATION_IDS or AUTH_SERVICE_BLOCKED_USER_IDS as described here.4. If the organization continues to overwhelm the system and causes our web-auth pods to crash, we may need to consider temporarily blocking the organization's IP until the system recovers and we address the automation responsible for the overload. You can identify the specific IP address from the api-gateway logsThe IP block will be enforced via AWS WAF. To block an IP using AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF), you can add a PR in terraform for WAF config:1. https://github.com/salsify/terraform-production/blob/master/production/api-gateway/waf.tf2.
