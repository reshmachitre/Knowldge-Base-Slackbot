High SKU Process / Large Opportunity EvaluationThe Large Opportunity Evaluation (formerly known as the High SKU Process) is a framework designed to help Sales and Product align on whether or not a customer / prospect is a good fit for our platform from a technical standpoint. It is largely driven through the Sales Engineering organization, but AMs and AEs should be aware that the process exists.The deck embedded below explains each dimension of scale which we are interested in and how to evaluate it. Slide 17 is a table of ability to serve various customer configurations. Anything in gray MUST go through the high SKU process. Anything in blue can be approved, however, if you have questions about a customer’s record count or family size please reach out to us before moving forward with the deal.Strategic OnlyWe think of strategic prospects as the set of globals that could really change our leverage in the market if we could develop a strong partnership with them. So as an example: a global nestle PCM contract would be highly strategic. Or the development partnership we had with L’Oreal in the early days.https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-HJ4EYTyw4TpU1VnMMiuKRTmAN8Dv6h3XJPe_S8Qo04/edit#slide=id.gd9e06a75fb_0_2802Initiating an Evaluation* Fill out the High SKU form with as much information as you have.* The group meets once a week to discuss any open deals (Tues evenings, ET) and progress is tracked on this Jira board.
