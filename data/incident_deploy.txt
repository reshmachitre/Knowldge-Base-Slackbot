Incident DeploysOverviewOur services are configured with CD which will automatically deploy the service when the test suite passes as is required for SOC compliance. However, in incident scenarios we may need to circumvent this check (e.g., CircleCI is down) to ensure we can deploy a fix. This runbook describes how to perform an emergency deploy with CD.NoteThis should only be used for incidents where we are allowed to bypass a passing test suite.Emergency DeployTo perform an emergency deploy that bypasses the passing test suite check, disable CD (uncheck “Enable Continuous Deployment” and click “Save”) via the “Configuration” tab for the service in Infa-Mgmt (example). You should then be able to use the “Deploy” button on the page to start a deploy that will not make a status check.NoteBe sure to re-enable continuous deployment when the incident is over.RollbackIn cases where you need to quickly rollback a deploy, sal provides a rollback command that will rollback all Deployments in a given namespace to the previous deploy. For example:sal k8s elevate --namespace alerts-service --context production --reason rollbacksal k8s application rollback --namespace alerts-service --context production
